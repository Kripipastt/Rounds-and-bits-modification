Version 0.1 is the original version of the Rounds and bits game. There are quite a lot of problems in it that I want to
try to fix, as well as refine the game the way I see it.

Version 0.1.1:
Removed the function of your music, because without it is impossible to build an exe file due to an error. Maybe
she'll come back someday.
